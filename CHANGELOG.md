## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Restored automatic battle progression in the production battle screen by
  attaching the current Supabase bearer token to SSE advance requests. Normal
  authenticated API calls remained available, but battle advancement returned
  HTTP 401 after the cloud authentication cutover.

### Operations

- Emergency release for a material production outage. The change affects only
  frontend request authentication; it has no database, backend API, provider,
  secret, or migration impact.
- Roll back by restoring the previously active Cloudflare Worker version. The
  Cloud Run revision and PostgreSQL schema do not need to be rolled back.

### Added

- Public repository governance with protected `main`, tag-restricted release
  environments, environment-scoped Cloudflare deployment credentials, secret
  push protection, and Dependabot security updates.
- Release governance covering versioning, required checks, immutable artifact
  promotion, database compatibility, rollback, and emergency releases.
- GitHub Actions validation, staged release and owner-confirmed production
  promotion, keyless Google Cloud deployment, smoke testing, and rollback.
